# 💫 About Me:
I am a **Senior IT Executive with 8+ years of hands-on experience** in **networking, systems administration, automation, and security**. Currently working in the **shipping and logistics domain**, I focus on building **reliable, secure, and scalable IT environments** that support business-critical operations.<br><br>

My work spans across **enterprise IT operations, Windows/Linux administration, Active Directory, PowerShell automation, cloud and security platforms, ITSM & ITAM processes, and infrastructure troubleshooting**. I enjoy solving real-world operational problems by simplifying processes through automation, documentation, and best-practice driven design.<br><br>

This GitHub repository and website together serve as a **living resume and technical portfolio**—covering **projects, lab proof, automation scripts, configuration references, skill progression, and real-world implementations** that reflect how things are done in production environments.<br><br>

I strongly believe in:<br><br>
* Automation over manual effort<br>
* Security by design, not as an afterthought<br>
* Clean documentation and repeatable, auditable processes<br><br>

I use GitHub not just to store code, but to **share knowledge, track continuous learning, and document practical IT solutions** that can help others in the field.<br><br>
