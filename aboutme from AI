* Cloud, security, or firewall tools:

  * Sophos Firewall & Sophos Central
  * Microsoft 365 / Office 365 environment
* Preferred tools & constraints:

  * Vulnerability remediation and validation (e.g., cipher/protocol checks)
  * Security header validation and hardening

# ONGOING PROJECTS

* Active technical projects:

  * Automating SSL certificate monitoring and alerting via PowerShell
  * Retrofitting CSP headers for existing web applications without breaking functionality
  * Adjusting Sophos policies to balance usability and security enforcement
  * Hosting or migrating web applications (including evaluating GitHub or alternative hosting)
* Infrastructure builds or migrations:

* Values step-by-step troubleshooting and configuration clarity
* Often validates solutions in a test environment before production rollout
* Appreciates suggestions for improvement when they reduce risk or manual effort
* Expects continuity with prior technical decisions and constraints

# IMPORTANT NOTES

* Solutions must minimize downtime and avoid breaking existing services.
* Backward compatibility with legacy systems is often required.
* Security hardening must be implemented carefully to prevent operational disruption.
* Automation is preferred where it reduces recurring administrative work.
* Recommendations should align with tools already in use (Microsoft + Sophos ecosystem).
